# 🎓 Final Project: University Management System

## 📝 Overview
I created a simple **University Management System** using Python. The system allows you to manage students, faculty, and courses. You can assign faculty to courses, enroll students in those courses, and store student data in a CSV file.

---

## 🔧 Project Requirements
- **OOP**: Implemented using classes and objects
- **Functions**: Logic is organized into reusable functions
- **Modules**: Separated code into different modules for clarity
- **CSV Handling**: Student records are stored in `students.csv`

---

## ⚙️ Features
1. **Create a Student**  
   Each student has a unique ID, name, major, and enrolled courses.  
   Student info is saved in `students.csv`.

2. **Create a Faculty**  
   Faculty has an ID, name, department, and assigned courses.

3. **Create a Course**  
   Each course has a unique ID, course name, instructor (faculty), and list of students.

4. **Assign Faculty to a Course**  
   Faculty can be assigned to a specific course.

5. **Enroll Students in a Course**  
   Students can enroll in multiple courses.  
   Duplicate enrollments are prevented.

6. **Display Reports**  
   - List all students  
   - List all courses with faculty  
   - Show students enrolled in a specific course

## 📁 Suggested File Structure
- `main.py`: Main program with logic flow
- `student.py`: Contains the `Student` class
- `faculty.py`: Contains the `Faculty` class
- `course.py`: Contains the `Course` class
- `students.csv`: Stores all student information
